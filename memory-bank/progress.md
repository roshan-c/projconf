# Progress: Project Configuration Tool

## Current Status
🟡 In Development

## What Works
- Project structure established
- Development environment set up
- Documentation framework created
- Memory bank initialized

## What's Left to Build
1. Core Functionality
   - [ ] Command-line argument parsing
   - [ ] Directory path validation
   - [ ] File generation system
   - [ ] Error handling implementation

2. File Templates
   - [ ] .clinerules template
   - [ ] README.md template
   - [ ] Template management system

3. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Cross-platform testing

4. Deployment
   - [ ] Build pipeline
   - [ ] PATH setup documentation
   - [ ] Installation verification

## Known Issues
- None yet (project in initial development)

## Project Evolution
### Phase 1 - Initial Setup (Current)
- ✅ Project created
- ✅ Memory bank established
- ⏳ Core implementation pending

### Phase 2 - Core Development
- ⏳ Implement main functionality
- ⏳ Create file templates
- ⏳ Add error handling

### Phase 3 - Testing & Refinement
- ⏳ Write tests
- ⏳ Cross-platform testing
- ⏳ Performance optimization

### Phase 4 - Deployment
- ⏳ Create build pipeline
- ⏳ Document PATH setup
- ⏳ Final testing

## Decision Log
1. Using C# for cross-platform compatibility
2. Template-based approach for file generation
3. Command-line only interface for simplicity
4. Single executable deployment for ease of use

## Upcoming Milestones
1. 🎯 Basic file generation working
2. 🎯 Command-line interface complete
3. 🎯 Error handling implemented
4. 🎯 Cross-platform compatibility verified
5. 🎯 PATH setup documented
